# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started  

First, you'll need to clone this code repo down to your local machine.  

Then, open it in your chosen development environment e.g. VS Code.  
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved this repo.  
Then run  
```
yarn install
or
npm install
```  
to get the node modules required.  


### Running the code locally  

Again, open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved this repo.  
run
```
yarn start
or
npm start
```  
to start the server.  

The app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Running the tests

Run  
```
yarn test
or
npm test
```  
to run the test suite.  

The tests are written with Jest.

### Notes  
The tests are very basic as I've not had to write frontend unit tests before in my current role. I took some time to learn the basics for this task, some of which I tried to implement but couldn't sucessfully get the desired outcome so removed the failing tests in that regard.  
We cover our backend with C# xunit tests instead and have no frontend tests as standard accross the business.  
I had to comment out the PropTypes so that the tests can sucessfully run as there was a problem there with passing props that were marked as required in the tests.  

I took the wireframe designs given in the task as a guide and not as absolutes. I used Bootstrap as the styling framework.  

As it stands I've not added any Linting rules as it's just me working on this task, but I would usually implement the AirBnB rules for team projects.  


### Future improvments  
The work here is by no means perfection and of course could be tidied up in places.  
For example, you can see I started to develop the "Optional Requirements" - I would idealy revisit the logic for the probability calculator to condense this or perhaps re-write it.  
I had an idea for animating the text for when you get a snap, but ran out of time. Ditto for adding sound effects.
